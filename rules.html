        The page has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed .The  game starts with the page lighting up one  button randomly, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the button. As the game progresses, the player needs to remember the order in which he presses the buttons and every time repeats the full order from the start.
